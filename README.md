## Lectures and Lab

The [`slides`](https://github.com/nathanshammah/interactive-notebooks/tree/master/slides) folder contains lectures given at ICTP Trieste in July 2019 covering:

- The dynamics of dissipative quantum systems

- Open-source software in quantum physics and quantum technology

- QuTiP, the Quantum Tooolbox in Python and its dynamics solvers

- How to make an open source package for a scientific project (see also the [qictp](https://github.com/nathanshammah/qictp) example library)

- How to host notebooks on the cloud

## Notebooks 

Notebooks using QuTiP can be found directly in the repository.
